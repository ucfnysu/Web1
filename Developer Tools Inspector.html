                            <p>Our anonymous data contains billions of visits to
                              locations in the Boston Metro Area from October
                              2016 to March 2017. We analyze mobility patterns of about 150,000 anonymous users, provided through <a href="https://www.cuebiq.com/about/data-for-good/">Cuebiq’s Data for Good initiative</a>, in the whole Boston Metro area (around 3% of the population). MIT Media Lab coupled Cuebiq's anonymous location data with census information to determine user income groups and identify user visitation patterns to places.
                              We use the census-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core-based_statistical_area" title="Wikipedia Core-based statistical areas">core-based statistical areas</a>
                              to define metro areas. This definition encompasses
                              the cities, suburbs, and commuting zones that are
                              economically tied to a central city of interest.
                              In the Boston case, it contains large areas in New
                              Hampshire and down the Massachusetts coast.
							  Finally, we have used the public Foursquare API to get the list of the 30,000 places that users visit.</p>

                        <li>
                            <h2>Estimating home and income</h2>
                            <p>Using the same anonymous data, we determine
                              users’ home location at the level of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_block_group" title="Wikipedia Census Block Group">Census Block Groups</a>,
                              a statistical subarea of census tracts that each
                              contain between 600 and 3,000 people. To determine
                              a user's home census block group, we compute the
                              most common block group that a user spends time in
                              between 8:00 pm and 4:00 am. We then assign each
                              user an income using the median household income
                              of their "home" census block group from the 5-year <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/" title="American Community Survey">American Community Survey</a> for 2012-2016.
                              Users were then clustered in 4 different quantile
                              groups of annual income: low ($10,000 - $67,000),
                              medium ($67,000 - $90,000), upper medium ($90,000 - $114,000),
                              and high (over $114,000). Each income group
                              contains exactly 1/4 of the users in our dataset.

                            within 20 meters from a place,
                            we treat them as having visited that place.

                            <h2>Measuring inequality in a place</h2>
                            <p>To measure inequality in a place, we first
                              compute the total time each user spends in a
                              venue, and then sort all users by their income
                              group. Then, we compute the total time each income
                              group spends in each place in our dataset. The end
                              result is a chart for each place that shows how
                              likely you are to see people from each income
                              quartile if you visit.
                            </p>
                            <img class="figure" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/c56a2d2a99db0be52ec57c74ce3a20223301ddb2/3f01b/img/methods-04-a.png">
                            <p> To measure the inequality of a place, we use a
                              city-wide normalized measure. Because income
                              groups correspond to exactly 25% of the users in
                              the area, a totally equal place would be visited
                              by each income group 25% of the time. This
                              corresponds to a flat chart, like the one on the
                              left. We consider any deviation from that flat
                              profile to contribute to inequality. For example,
                              a totally segregated place would show a chart more
                              like the one on the right, with 100% of the users
                              coming from a single income group. Mathematically,
                              we calculate the absolute deviation of a place's
                              income distribution from that flat ideal:
                            </p>

                            <p>and normalize it to be between 0% (flat
                            distribution) to 100% (only one group is present).</p>

                            <h2>Limitations</h2>
                            <p>There are several limitations with our approach
                            that could mean our results are incomplete. First,
                            we select users based on having consistent home
                            locations during the 6 months of our dataset. This
                            excludes smartphone users who are homeless, in
                            transition, or those users who work non-normative
                            work shifts (between 8pm and 4am). Second, the venues
                              we consider are limited to those available via the
                              Foursquare API. Third, our approach to determing
                              whether a user visits a place does not account for
                              GPS noise, and so some of our records of users
                              visiting places could be wrong. See the FAQ for
                              more about data representativeness.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Additionally, it is important to note that the
                              Atlas records income inequality, not class
                              inequality. The lowest income quantile we use
                              encompasses a huge range of both income and
                              socioeconomic difference, covering neighborhoods
                              with median household incomes between $10,000 and
                              $67,000 per year. The qualitative class
                              differences
                              (lifestyle, opportunity, etc) between a household
                              with $20,000 of annual income and $60,000 of
                              annual income are extremely large in the Boston
                              area. Income is also known to be an imperfect
                              proxy for class; many highly wealthy households
                              have little annual income.

                          spend their time. The way we experience economic
                          inequality in cities is impacted by where we go, not just by where we live.

                    <p>When you want to grab a cup of coffee, where do you go?
                    Does it depend on whether you’re at home or at work? How
                    many other coffee shops do you pass on the way to your
                    favorite spot?</p>
                    <p>We all have our own preferences and needs -- like
                    choosing a latte or a simple cup of black coffee. When we
                    head out into our cities and towns, we use our preferences
                    to decide where to spend our time. <b>Through these choices, we build our habits and routines.</b></p>
                    <p>The fact that our routines decide where we spend our time
                      also means that they decide who we spend our time with.
                      Although we may get our daily coffee on the same city block, the specific
                      places we're in -- and the people around us --
                      can be radically different.

                    <p>In Boston, like in other cities, coffee shops can occupy
                    places as close as a few feet apart. The two coffee in the
                    figure above are on the same city block. Although they are
                    within 2 minute walk of one another, the incomes of the
                    people who visit them are very different.</p>
                    <p>Coffeehouse 2 is visited almost exclusively by people
                    we’ve identified as being in Boston’s lowest income bracket,
                    while Coffeehouse 1 has visitors more representative of all
                    incomes. The choice of which coffee shop to visit can
                    contribute significantly to income segregation.</p>
                    <p>It’s important to note that these choices that people
                    make are usually constrained by things like affordability,
                    location, and social groups. But a place where people of all
                    different incomes come together can be on the same block as
                    a place where only the poorest -- or the wealthiest -- spend
                    their time. This means that socio-economic inequality in
                    cities is encoded in part by these choices, not just where
                    people live.</p>

                              In general, yes. To test if our sample of users is
                              representative, we’ve run several analyses
                              comparing the incomes of people in our dataset to
                              census reports, and the average income of our user
                              sample is only 8.6% higher than the census data.
                              To test if our method of detecting when a person
                              spends time in a place is accurate, we use our
                              data to estimate attendance at professional sports
                              games (NFL, NBA, and the NHL). Estimates of
                              attendance computed using our data are extremely
                              close to official attendance counts, which suggests
                              that the data we use here can describe visits to a
                              specific place quite well (generally within a few thousand of the official attendance counts).

                            <p>
                              A place is unequal if it is not visited by the
                              four different income quartiles we've identified
                              in the city. A high value of inequality in a place
                              means that most of its visitors come from one or
                              two of these income groups. You can find more
                              information about how the inequality score is
                              computed in the Methods section.

                            <p>We determine that a user has spent time in a
                            place when our data shows that they’ve spent more
                            than five minutes within 20 meters of it. We’ve
                            tried our best to be careful in assigning user
                            locations to places, but our method isn’t perfect.
                            When places are very close to each other (less than 20 meters), or where places are on different floors of the same building, our data is a little more noisy. Please let us know about the specific place in question by <a href="mailto:inequality@media.mit.edu?subject=Problem%20with%20a%20place" title="Send an email" target="_blank">sending us an email</a>, and we will investigate it.
